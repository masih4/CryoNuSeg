# performing manual instance annotation with ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html)
1- select an image 
2- analyse --> tools --> ROI manager
3- zoom as mush as you want
4- perform manual segmentation (either with mouse or with Bella's device)
5- save at the end (...ROI manager--> more --> save). Inside the created zip file you should be able to see all ROIs

notes: 
* make sure that you use "freehand selection" to perform manual annotations (select it from the main ImageJ window)
* in case you want to delete something--> click on the number inside the ROI and then press Del
* in ROI manager tick the boxes for both "labels" and "show all" (to see your annotation immediately)
* you can save your work even if you are not done with an image and load it later (for loading: ROI manager --> more --> open)
