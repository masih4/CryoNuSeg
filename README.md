# CryoNuSeg: A Dataset for Nuclei Segmentation of Cryosectioned H\&E-Stained Histological Images
[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-MATLAB-<COLOR>.svg)](https://shields.io/)

CryoNuSeg is the first fully annotated dataset of frozen H\&E-Stained histological images. The dataset includes 30 image patches with a fix size of 512x512 pixels of 10 human organs. <a href="https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a> was the main source for creating this dataset.
